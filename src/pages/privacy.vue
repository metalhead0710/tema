                        <p>With Privacy and Data Protection (PDP), PlatOps will help you protect your sensitive business data and help you meet compliance requirements related to data storage and protection.</p>
                        <p>We’ll also help you assess your risk, create custom policies to encrypt and restrict access to sensitive data, and report on data access — helping to ensure that your important data remains protected.</p>
                        <p>When paired with PlatOps Managed Security, you’ll also receive additional 24x7x365 threat monitoring, response and analytics. We can then compare your data access information with other data feeds to identify behavioral anomalies and potential threats.</p>
                        <h5>Understand Your Risk</h5>
                        <p>We’ll work with you to help you understand — and mitigate — your risk:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>We’ll assess the different types of data you generate and store</li>
                            <li>We’ll help you create a data-classification policy</li>
                            <li>We’ll establish the sensitivity of each type of data</li>
                            <li>We’ll make recommendations on how to best protect it</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Restrict Access to Data</h5>
                        <p>We use the data classification policy we created in the phase above to encrypt and restrict access to customer data.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>We deploy and configure a data security platform and agents into your environment</li>
                            <li>We create custom access policies</li>

                        <h5>Use Detailed Reporting</h5>
                        <p>We’ll track your data usage and protection measures, and generate detailed reports about access to sensitive data that you can use to help meet compliance objectives.</p>
